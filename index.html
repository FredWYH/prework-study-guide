        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS fill in or provides the style and colours of how the site or app will look.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>An * selector or wild card symbol declares ALL elements of the page will have the style properties written in the section</li>
          <li>Width defined as 100% allows the stylesheet to adjust the content to fit to screen or device size.</li>
          <li>Colour assignment can be either defined by semantic references like gray or blue, but more accurately defined by hexadecimal code or hex # like #ACACAC which can be found from https://htmlcolorcodes.com/</li>

          <li>git diff: to find out what file difference are there to be committed.</li>
